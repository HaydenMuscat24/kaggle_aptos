# Aptos Challenge

9417 Kaggle project.

##Folder Structure:
- download the data from https://www.kaggle.com/c/aptos2019-blindness-detection/data and extract it to the folder 'aptos2019-blindness-detection'
- additional folder for more data will be found
- 'resnet50weightsfile' contains the base resnet NN weights which we train from
- 'trained-networks' will contain resnet50 network weights trained thus far
- submission.ipynb will be what is provided to kaggle as a submission (along with relevant weights files)


##Todo:
- find a good way to automatically pip install required modules on a new system
